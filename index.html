        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Recovering designer. Recovering journalist. Recovering educator. Recovering manager.
        Delightfully unemployed.</p>
        <p> I have opinions about COGs, a knack for building multi-million dollar business units
           and the amazing teams to run them. Background in design, development, and all manner
          of media communication (print, web, radio, video).(whew!)</p>

        <p>I've been lucky enough to work with great teams while finding enough room to
          innovate into new areas while being asked to call on past experience for leadership.

        I'm a fan of empowerment who isn't particularly concerned with permission.
        (That simply means I am a pain in the ass to work with sometimes).

        While I have built successful products, my strength is rooted in working with
        and building strong teams that power those products and grow beyond their initial objective.

        Great organizations learn the most through research, creation, analysis, and iteration.
         If you repeat this cycle enough times and you'll have a pretty good idea of who
         your customer is and how to serve them, which is exactly what the top priority
         of every business should beâ€”regardless of the industry.</p>
